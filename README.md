# UEVRTargetPercentages

## Purpose

This mod script allows you to set different DLSS screen percentages for each distinct view target within a UEVR game in order to optimise your GPU usage for different areas of games. 
For example this can be used in "The Alters" to assign a high screen percentage whilst inside the base, where GPU usage is lower, and a lower screen percentage whilst exploring outside the base, where GPU usage is higher.

## Compatibility

This script will only be useful in games where the view target of the camera is set to specific targets for specific sections of the game.
When you go to the Script UI tab, you can see all view targets you have set a percentage for, as well as the current view target, denoted by a (*).

## Installation

Copy the screenpercentagetargets.lua script into the scripts folder of your UEVR game before injecting.
